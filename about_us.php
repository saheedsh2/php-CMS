          <h2>Brief <strong>Introduction</strong> About National Assembly Service Commission</h2>

            <div class="col-md-12 align-left">
          <p>The National Assembly Service Commission is one of the organs of the Nigerian Legislature. It is vested with the powers of Appointment, Promotion and Discipline of staff of the National Assembly Service as well as establishing working conditions and Scheme of service for the staff. The other organs of the Legislature are the Public Complaints Commission (PCC), National Institute for Legislative and Democratic Studies (NILDS), National Assembly Service Management (NASS, MGT) and National Assembly Budget and Research Office (NABRO). 
          <br />
           <br />
          

            The Commission was established vide National Assembly Service Commission Act 2000 which was amended as National Assembly Service Act 2014 that made it autonomous in decision making and procedures. The law protects the Commission against administrative and political interference in discharging its responsibilities.
             <br />

            The law also ensures that the Commission has a balanced representation in the composition of the National Assembly Service personnel in accordance with the Federal Character principle provided for in section 3(9) of the National Assembly Service Act 2014 (As Amended) and enshrined in section 14 (3) of the Constitution (As Amended).
             <br />  <br />

            A Member of the Commission shall hold office for a period of 5 years from the date of his appointment and he may be reappointed for another term of 5 years and no more.
            In carrying out its mandate, the Commission strives to ensure that the principles of fairness, equity, justice and the rule of law are adhered to in all its operations.
